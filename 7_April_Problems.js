//Create a function that takes an array of non-negative integers and strings and return a new array without the strings.
//Examples: filterArray([1, 2, "a", "b"]) ➞ [1, 2]
//As shown in example, you have to filter out strings and keep only integers in array

//Create a function that takes an array as an argument and 
//returns true or false depending on whether the average of all elements in the array is a whole number or not.
//Examples: isAvgWhole([1, 3]) ➞ true, isAvgWhole([1, 2, 3, 4]) ➞ false
//Whole numbers means, a number without fractions. So in first example average of 2 elements is (1 + 3)/2 = 2, which is whole numbers
//hence it returned true


//Create a function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array, sorted in ascending order (smallest to biggest)
//Examples : sortNumsAscending([1, 2, 10, 50, 5]) ➞ [1, 2, 5, 10, 50], sortNumsAscending([80, 29, 4, -95, -24, 85]) ➞ [-95, -24, 4, 29, 80, 85]
//You have to sort array of numbers in ascending order

//Create a function that sorts an array and removes all duplicate items from it.
//Examples: set([1, 3, 3, 5, 5]) ➞ [1, 3, 5], set([4, 4, 4, 4]) ➞ [4]
//as shown in examples, you have to remove the duplicates from an array and arrange them in ascending order

//Create a function that takes an array and returns the sum of all numbers in the array.
//Examples: getSumOfItems([2, 7, 4]) ➞ 13
//as shown in example you are expected to return sum of all numbers inside of an array

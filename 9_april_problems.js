//Que 1: A student learning JavaScript was trying to make a function. 
//His code should concatenate a passed string name with string "Edabit" and store it in a variable called result. 
//Examples: nameString("Mubashir") ➞ "MubashirEdabit", nameString("Matt") ➞ "MattEdabit"

//Que 2: Create a function that returns the number of arguments it was called with
//Examples: numArgs() ➞ 0, numArgs("foo") ➞ 1

//Que 3: Create a function that takes a string of lowercase characters and returns that string reversed and in upper case
//Examples: reverseCapitalize("abc") ➞ "CBA", reverseCapitalize("hellothere") ➞ "EREHTOLLEH"

//Que 4: You are given an array of integers having both negative and positive values, except for one integer which can be negative or positive. 
//Create a function to find out that integer.
//Examples: lonelyInteger([1, -1, 2, -2, 3]) ➞ 3
// 3 has no matching negative appearance.

//Que 5: A palindrome is a word that is identical forward and backwards.
//mom, racecar, kayak -> palidromes
//create a function that checks whether it is a palindrome
//Examples: checkPalindrome("mom") ➞ true, checkPalindrome("scary") ➞ false
